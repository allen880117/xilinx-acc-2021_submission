# OrderBookResponse
# The only differences between responses
# are `bidPrice` and `askPrice`.
# `symbolIndex` should be different, but
# in our testbench they are set to dummy numbers.
# Make sure '#' at the beginning of each line
# of the comment is followed by at least one space.
# Remember to add new line at the end of the file
# and make sure no empty lines in the middle of the file.
# `responseCount` is the integer in first line.
